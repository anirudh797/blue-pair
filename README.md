# Blue Pair

### Overview
Simple Bluetooth Android app for handling device discovery and pairing.

### Quickstart
1. From the app main screen, tap on the button at the bottom right corner to start Bluetooth device discovery. If the Bluetooth is not enabled, the app will turn it on for you.

2. Each device discovered will be listed on this screen with its name and/or its MAC address. Notice that a Bluetooth device may not have a name but he will always have a MAC address.
